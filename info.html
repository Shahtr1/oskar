		<p>This is the true story of one remarkable man who outwitted <b>Hitler</b> and the Nazis to save more Jews from the gas chambers than any other during World War II.</p>
		<p>It is the story of <b>Oscar Schindler</b> who surfaced from the chaos of madness, spent millions bribing and paying off the SS and eventually risked his life to rescue the Schindler-Jews. You may read the letter written by his Jews May, 1945 <a href="letter.html">here</a>.</p>
		<p>Oscar Schindler rose to the highest level of humanity, walked through the bloody mud of the Holocaust without soiling his soul, his compassion, his respect for human life -  and gave his Jews a second chance at life. He miraculously managed to do it and pulled it off by using the very same talents that made him a war profiteer - his flair for presentation, bribery, and grand gestures.</p>
		<p>To more than 1200 Jews Oscar Schindler was all that stood between them and death at the hands of the Nazis. A man full of flaws like the rest of us - the unlikeliest of all role models who started by earning millions as a war profiteer and ended by spending his last pfennig and risking his life to save his Jews. An ordinary man who even in the worst of circumstances did extraordinary things, matched by no one. He remained true to his Jews, the workers he referred to as <b>my children</b>. In the shadow of Auschwitz he kept the SS out and everyone alive.</p>
		<p>Oscar Schindler and his wife Emilie Schindler were inspiring evidence of courage and human decency during the Holocaust. Emilie was not only a strong woman working alongside her husband but a heroine in her own right. She worked indefatigably to save the Schindler-Jews - a story to bear witness to goodness, love and compassion.</p>
		<p>Today there are more than <b>7,000</b> descendants of the Schindler-Jews living in US and Europe, many in Israel. Before the Second World War, the Jewish population of Poland was <b>3.5 million</b>. Today there are between <b>3,000</b> and <b>4,000</b> left.</p>
		<p>Oscar Schindler spent millions to protect and save his Jews, everything he possessed. He died penniless. But he earned the everlasting gratitude of the Schindler-Jews. Today his name is known as a household word for courage in a world of brutality - a hero who saved hundreds of Jews from Hitler's gas chambers.</p>
		<p>Schindler died in Hildesheim in Germany October 9, 1974. He wanted to be buried in Jerusalem. As he said: <b>My children</b> are here ..</p>
